Java Wither is really not fun to fight, most people choose to cheese it.

I removed the cheese in my modpack, but the Wither was too strong for the balance of the pack. This mod gives a little extra breathing room when fighting it.

- When above 50% health:
  - The wither floats more slowly
  - The wither cannot easily change direction

These changes mean running directly underneath the Wither is a great way to get distance from it, while it overshoots and has to turn around to catch up to you.

I strongly recommend pairing this mod with:
  - Wither Fix, stops the Wither being cheesed: https://modrinth.com/datapack/wither-fix
  - BE Style Wither, gives it a melee phase 2 and new attacks (that perfectly aligns with this mod): https://modrinth.com/mod/be-style-wither
